# Overview
# ========
#
# This file contains the arguments for invoking maven when using Diffblue Cover. Cover will render the command to
# execute based on the "phase" that's being executed by assembling the flags, plugin options, and any filtering
# arguments. For example, if we're trying to execute the build phase on windows without any of the named plugins
# present, you can expect the invoked command to look (something) like (forgiving the abuse of line breaks):
#
# mvnw.cmd \
#     -Dmaven.ext.class.path=/path/to/maven-spy.jar -Dcom.diffblue.cover.skipTests=true --batch-mode \
#     --projects=project --settings=/path/to/user/settings.xml --global-settings=/path/to/global/settings.xml \
#     install -Dmaven.compiler.failOnWarning=false --also-make
#
# The first line comes from the 'cmd' stanza (selected by the renderer based on detected operating system). The next
# two lines of the command come from the 'global' stanza, while the final line comes from the specification of the
# build phase.
#
# Phases
# ======
#
# There are (currently) eight phases that Cover progresses through during the various executions. They are listed
# below along with examples of commands where they're invoked:
#
# info      : dcover create             : gathering information about the structure of the project (child-modules, etc.);
#                                         the classpath is not guaranteed to be correctly resolved at this stage.
# classpath : dcover create             : computes the project structure and classpath of the project under test
# launcher  : dcover create             : downloads the JUnit Jupiter Launcher if needed
# clean     : dcover build --clean      : cleans the existing target/build files from the modules
# build     : dcover build              : rebuilds the modules
# test      : dcover create             : runs the tests of the module, can be filtered based on type (e.g. Diffblue,
#                                         non-Diffblue, or a named test)
# coverage  : dcover coverage-reports   : runs the tests and records the coverage, can be filtered like the test phase
# refactor  : dcover fix-build          : applies any refactorings
# validate  : dcover validate           : runs all the tests, both diffblue and manual
#
# Variable Substitution
# =====================
#
# Throughout this file there are a number of variables that need to be substituted to make the commands work. These
# are of the form ${VARIABLE}. For substitution to work the VARIABLE must match exactly one of the known variables
# (listed below), if it doesn't match exactly it will be filtered out.
#

# Note: Only the MODULE_PATH can be the empty string, all other variables that evaluate to the empty string will be
# filtered out before being executed.
#
# Plugins
# =======
#
# There are times when Cover needs to enable or disable some plugins. For example, as part of the environment checks we
# execute a DummyTest to check whether tests can be detected and executed by the build system, in this case we don't
# need to worry about formatting the file to match any spotless or checkstyle configurations as it doesn't remain in the
# project once the check has completed. However, the tests that are created will need to abide by whatever
# spotless/checkstyle configuration is present. It only makes sense to include these flags if the specific plugin(s)
# are present in the configuration for the build.
#
# In short: the plugins will be enabled/disabled conditionally and will only be included depending on their presence
# in the project.

  version: 3.2
