# This action is used to overwrite a target remote branch with a given source branch.
# This is mainly intended to be used for synchronising the integration and master branches
# via a third intermediary branch which contains all commits from both.

# The recommended workflow is to update the integration and master branches in the
# contributor's fork to be in sync with upstream finos repo. Then branch from integration,
# rebase on top of master and push the resulting branch to the upstream fions repo.
# Finally, run this action twice, with the source branch being the newly pushed branch
# and the target branch being master and then integration.
